              The front-end was built using React, Redux, and React Router,
              Styled-Components, and leveraged JSON Web Tokens for
              authentication. React-Intl/Format.js was also used for
              Internationalization.

            <li>
              Collaborated with a team of developers to build the EVO WordPress
              SEO Plugin which allowed users to easily add and manage SEO for
              their WordPress web properties.
              <br />
              The plugin was built using PHP, jQuery, Sass, and MySQL using a
              containerized Docker environment for rapid local development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also collaborated to develop the front-end for the EVO Member
              Portal where users could manage and purchase subscription keys for
              their sites using the plugin so that they may take advantage of
              features such as Google Search Console and Google Analytics
              integrations.
              <br />
              It was built using React, React Router, Redux, Sass, and utilized

            <li>
              Containerized the EVO Plugin website into a Docker environment for
              easier development, QA, iteration history, and deployment to a
              Production environment.
              <br />
              The website design and implementation were contracted out to a
              third-party which did not conform to our usual development and
              deployment processes.

              styles between multiple developers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrote tests for the Mocha, Jest, and PHPUnit testing frameworks to
              ensure code was accurate, and to prevent regressions from future
              iterations on the codebase.
            </li>

              Performed code reviews for Pull Requests, and performed QA duties
              before merging code.
